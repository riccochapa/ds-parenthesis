Parenthesis.js
Write a stack client Parentheses.js that reads in sequence of left and right parentheses, braces, and brackets from standard input and uses a stack to determine whether the sequence is properly balanced. For example, your program should print true for [()]{}{[()()]()} and false for [(]).
